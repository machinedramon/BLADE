# BLADE: Bluetooth Link Access and Data Exchange

## Overview

BLADE is an advanced framework designed to establish a bridge between HTTP requests and Bluetooth communications, allowing for seamless interaction with Bluetooth devices via a local server. This server manages device connections, facilitating operations such as service discovery, data exchange, and file transfers with both classic Bluetooth and BLE devices through HTTP requests.

## Key Features

- Unified Device Management for both classic Bluetooth and BLE devices.
- Comprehensive Service Discovery for connected devices.
- Robust Data Exchange mechanisms for sending commands and receiving data.
- File Transfer capabilities via OBEX for supported devices.
- Simplified interactions through an HTTP-based interface.

## Technical Specifications

### System Interaction Flow

1. **HTTP Request Reception**: The server receives an HTTP request targeting a specific Bluetooth device's MAC address or a service endpoint.
2. **Request Parsing**: It parses the request to extract relevant parameters, such as the device identifier (MAC address) and requested action (e.g., service discovery, data exchange).
3. **Bluetooth Communication**: Based on the parsed request, the server initiates a Bluetooth connection to the targeted device, performing operations like service discovery or data transmission.
4. **Response Generation**: After completing the Bluetooth operation, the server constructs an HTTP response encapsulating the outcome, which may include a list of services, data received from the device, or confirmation of a successful operation.
5. **HTTP Response Delivery**: The generated response is sent back to the requester, providing detailed outcomes or data obtained from the Bluetooth device.

### External Libraries

- Flask: For the HTTP server framework.
- bleak: For BLE device communications.
- PyBluez: For classic Bluetooth device interactions.

## Example Usage

Upon executing the BLADE server script, the terminal output might look like this:

\```console
üì° HTTP Bluetooth Server starting...
üîç Searching for paired devices on Windows...
‚úÖ Paired devices found.
‚úÖ Device discovery complete.
üì± Device: Mormaii Life, Type: BLE
üì± Device: ROG Phone 5s, Type: Classic
üîó Exposed device: Mormaii Life - http://localhost:8080/CC-52-83-36-B5-1B/services
üîó Exposed device: ROG Phone 5s - http://localhost:8080/04-D9-F5-BE-E8-A9/services
üì° HTTP Bluetooth Server started.

\```

A sample GET request to `http://localhost:8080/04-D9-F5-BE-E8-A9/services` would yield:

\```console
$ curl http://localhost:8080/04-D9-F5-BE-E8-A9/services
\```

\```json
{
  "request_time": "2024-02-26T01:56:24Z",
  "request_type": "GET",
  "services": [
    {
      "description": "",
      "name": null,
      "port": 31,
      "profile_count": 0,
      "profiles": [],
      "protocol": "L2CAP",
      "provider": null,
      "service_classes": ["Unknown Service (b'1801')"]
    },
    ...
  ],
  "total_services_found": 14
}
\```

## API Reference

### Available Endpoints

| Endpoint    | Description                                             |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| /services   | Retrieves service information for a specified device.   |
| /connect    | (Example) Initiates a connection to a specified device. |
| /disconnect | (Example) Terminates the connection with a device.      |
| /transfer   | (Example) Initiates a file transfer to a device.        |

### Example Request Formats

- **Service Discovery Request**:
    \```console
    $ curl http://localhost:8080/<device_mac>/services
    \```
- **Connect to Device**:
    \```console
    $ curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/connect -d '{"device_mac": "<device_mac>"}'
    \```
- **Send Data to a Service**:
    \```console
    $ curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/<device_mac>/<service_uuid>/send -d '{"data": "Hello World"}'
    \```

### Response Formatting

Responses are JSON formatted, providing clear and structured data about the request outcomes, including service discovery results, confirmation of actions taken, and data received from devices.
